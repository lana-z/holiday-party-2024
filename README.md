## Features & Security

- RSVP system with plus-one option and dietary restrictions
- Guest chat/message board with real-time updates
- Responsive party invitation for mobile browsers
- Add to Google Calendar functionality
- Custom domain
- Guest-only access system with authentication via 4-digit code
- Real-time Redis database integration
- Admin panel for managing RSVPs
- CORS protection via Vercel/Next.js API routes
- Basic rate limiting and DDoS protection via Vercel
- Built-in CSRF protection for Next.js form submissions
- Environment variable configuration
- No sensitive data exposed in client-side code

### Security considerations:
This application is designed for casual event RSVP management and is not intended for handling highly sensitive data.
- Guest codes are stored in localStorage for convenience without HTTP-only cookies
- Add application-level rate limiting for the endpoint `/api/verify-guest` for increased security


## Admin Access
After setting up your admin token, access the admin panel at `/admin` and use your token to:
- View all RSVPs
- Reset guest or delete test RSVPs
